# TTH_TD_Project_6

For this project we built a mineral catalog website with Django Web Framework.

There is a home page with a list of close to 900 minerals. One can click on any item
to be brought to it's detail page. This is where the impoortant information of the 
mineral will be displayed. Lastly, feel free to click on the "Show me a random mineral!"
button if you want to be shown a random mineral from the list.
